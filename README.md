This website is all about making movie nights, especially sleepovers, a lot more fun and interactive. You can easily search for movies based on your mood, favorite genre, or actor, or just hit the "Surprise Me" button if you’re feeling spontaneous. Planning a movie night is simple—you can create an event, invite your friends, and vote on what to watch together, all in real-time. The app also lets you create themed movie nights, like '80s classics or action-packed adventures. Plus, there are fun games like a Movie Night Bingo-Scavenger Hunt, where you compete to spot things happening on screen, and you can challenge your friends with trivia or polls, deciding things like "Funniest Dialogue" or "Best Scene." You can also keep track of your movie history, so each movie night feels special.
